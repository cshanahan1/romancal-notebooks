That means that if you are in the base conda environment and there are packages in it they will be available in the new environment unless you reinstall them there. This is generally bad because Python will also load packages from that base environment. A case, which is often a source for consfusion, is when ipython is not installed in the new environment but is available in the base one. Starting ipython owrks and loading a package may work but this package is imported from the base env and most often is a version different from what's desired.)\n",
