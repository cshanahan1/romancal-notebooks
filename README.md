# romancal-notebooks

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for understanding how to run the Roman pipeline 
or related issues, such as how to create a reference file.

There is an STScI Box folder that contains example data used in some of the notebooks.
Instructions on downloading the files are contained in the relevent notebooks themselves.
